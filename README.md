# NixOS Configuration

This is my experimental nixos-unstable setup for AMD Based System.

This provides a simple modular setup based on the well-renouned [Nix-Starter-Configs](https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-starter-configs).

The build-system is based on Nix Flakes and provides a reproducible environment on every amd setup.

## Prerequisites
